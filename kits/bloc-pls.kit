          <p><strong>Learning is the primary motivation for everything I do with&nbsp;design</strong>. I've actually been tossing around the idea of going through a program like Bloc for a while now. Iron Yard, Hack Reactor, Apprentice.io, General Assembly, Center Centre, and even Bloc have all been considered at some point. But this position seems like the best of both&nbsp;worlds.</p>
          <p>There were a number of things that stood out to me in the posting. The fact that you all are a team of generalists and that designers own their projects from start to finish is extremely important to me, as that's how I've always worked. But one sentence stood out well above the&nbsp;rest:
          <p class="quote">"Weâ€™re driven by the passion to create high quality work that makes our students and mentors better at what they&nbsp;do"</p>
          <p>I love that. User Experience is what makes or breaks an organization in this day and age. Knowing that <strong>every single moment</strong> an organization has with someone is part of that experience proves how human an organization really is. <em>I so badly want to work with passionate humans</em>, especially Emelyn whose <a href="http://emelynbaker.com/">work is extremely(n)&nbsp;impressive</a>.</p>
          <p>The digital design community has given me more than I could ever ask for, and to give back through an opportunity like this would make me super&nbsp;happy.</p>
