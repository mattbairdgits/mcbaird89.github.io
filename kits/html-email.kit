			<h1>Responsive HTML Email<br>AKA Malleable Table Inception</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>You heard it right, friend. I design and code HTML emails to render properly in dozens of clients on all kinds of devices. I know what you're thinking. <strong>Why would anyone even try?</strong> What can I say, I enjoy the challenge <em>*flex*</em>.</p>
			<p>I'm a huge advocate for <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/Email-Blueprints">Mailchimp's Email Blueprints</a>. Fabio Carneiro did a fantastic job, and I was able to build upon his modules to create some of my own. And then, of course, there's <a href="https://litmus.com/">Litmus</a>. I don't even want to think about how people went about testing their emails before&nbsp;Litmus.</p>
			<p>I'll keep a few of my recent designs on here since Mailchimp archives them. And probably skip the ones I end up not liking.</p>
