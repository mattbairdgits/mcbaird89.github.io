      <h4>Why Uber?</h4><br>
      <p>The first time I tried Uber happened to coincide with my first experience of San Francisco. The wonderful drivers took my friends and I places we would have been unable to get to otherwise, whether we were simply too far away or just plain exhausted. I remember walking uphill to Bernal Heights with burning calves after an entire day of exploring on foot, and then hopping in a car driven by a nice gentlemen to be whisked back to my friends' apartment. Riding around with Uber became part of my vacation instead of just a means to an end.</p>
      <p>So when I saw the job posting on the Litmus Community forums from Matt Byrd, I got a bit giddy. And then felt a pang of nostalgia. I decided I would go for it, because I have lived and breathed responsive email for the past two years. I transformed the entire way our agency handles email, and that's something I take pride in. <strong>It's&nbsp;frustratingly&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;and&nbsp;fun.</strong></p>
      <p>Here's a self-initiated design challenge I put together. I'm probably stepping into some weird legal territory with this, but this page is as private as you can get on a static site. The email is within an iframe, so feel free to pop open some dev tools and copy the code to test it in&nbsp;Litmus&nbsp;:)</p>
