          <p>Unfortunately I wasn't sure who to address, but whoever you are, <strong>thank you for taking the time to read this and consider me.</strong> I found out about the position through the <a class="inline" href="http://dynamicsjs.com/">dynamics.js demo page</a> and knew instantly I had to give it a shot. Stripe's branding is superb! The trust and quality being conveyed through all of the design gives me a strong feeling that those values are truly at the core of Stripe's culture.</p>
          <p>I've thought of myself as a (junior) full-stack designer for some time, shortly after "full-stack developer" really caught on. There isn't a single aspect of design I don't want to learn more of, and I believe that you must have a solid understanding of a medium before you can design for it. I've done everything from lettering to making changes to front-end code in rails environments, and I'd love the opportunity to continue getting my hands dirty at Stripe.</p>
          <p>Enough type. I hope my work can speak for itself</p>
