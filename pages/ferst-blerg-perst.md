The First Blog Post / for / Internets
~ 1/16/2015 ~

  I don't want to write or create anything grand here, like tell you my life story or something. But I will tell you that I've done arguably too much soul searching, and I'm still not done. Being open to multiple paths is making things easier.

  What I really want to do is describe what the intention of this "blog" is. I'm writing to write, to play, to explore, and ultimately, to learn. There will be words, code snippets, and designs-a-plenty! GET EXCITED. pls

  My next post will be a proof-of-concept UI, and the idea behind it, that have been on my mind for some time now. I'm giving myself a deadline of 1/22. Go team!
